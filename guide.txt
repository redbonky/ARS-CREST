This is my (bonky's) space orbit simulator, it's currently entirely based on gravity and mass calculations and doesn't have things like rotation and it's resultant prograde/retrograde motion

Keys: WASD for move camera, Q and E for zoom in and out (higher zoom/scale means smaller distances), R to reset camera, V to set zoom manually, P to reset all data requests

In order to make a simulation you need to use a setup code for it to interpret (if you're lazy you can just copy something from here)
The first half of the code is for the celestial body setup (called the bodycode), the second half of the code is for the data requests (called the requestcode), the halves are separated by a "; "

Each section of the bodycode or requestcode (either a singular body or a singular data request) is separated by ", ", each argument of a section is separated by "."

All particle codes follow the same order: Y, X, Y Velocity, X Velocity, Mass, Color, Name
So 0.-1000.-18.0.1e15.brightcyan.Cyan particle is an object with coordinates (-1000,0) (because x and y are swapped), velocity (0,-18), mass 1e15 (you can write numbers in normal or scientific form), color of bright cyan (there's a specific color dictionary available that I'll list, let me know if you want more specificity), and name 'Cyan particle'
The particle ID of an object is it's position in your setup code, the first position is 0, second is 1 and so on, you need to know it's ID if you're using a data request on it

The available colors are Black, Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, Purple, Cyan, Silver, Grey, Brightred, Brightgreen, Brightyellow, Brightblue, Pink, Brightcyan, and White (these are not case-sensitive)
Unlike particle codes, request codes have different lengths, so they'll use a different number of "."s
All request codes begin with their name

There are currently 8 data requests:
"camhelper" gives the location and zoom of the camera, as well as the offset of all particles relative to your camera (to help find them), does not have arguments (e.g. camhelper)
"pos" gives the location of a particle, it's argument is the number ID of it's particle (e.g. pos.0)
"particlespeed" gives the meters per frame speed (not per second, framerate is shown) (e.g. particlespeed.0)
"gravitationalforce1" gives the gravitational force affecting both particles in it's comparison, this force is equal (e.g. gravitationalforce1.0.1)
"gravitationalforce2" is the same but it gives the real gravitational force affecting it's first particle, taking into account it's mass (which significantly decreases it) (e.g. gravitationalforce2.0.1)
"particledist" gives the meter distance between both particles in it's comparison, (e.g. particledist.0.1)
"speedmeasure" gives the minimum and maximum speed that a particle has moved at in it's lifetime (e.g. speedmeasure.0)
"orbitdist" gives the apoapsis (highest distance) and periapsis (lowest distance) that two particles have been at in their lifetime, this is a rudimentary way of getting an orbit size, although it will break if the primary (second parameter) isn't stationary, or if the secondary (first parameter) isn't in a stable enough orbit, the third parameter is 0 or 1 for displaying the approximate apoapsis and periapsis position (from the secondary), and the fourth parameter is colour (e.g. 0.1.1.cyan)

Example setup codes:
This one has 2 particles orbiting around a particle 10 times the mass in sync, as well as orbit displays for both of them, the speeds of the cyan particle, and camhelper
0.-1000.-18.0.1e15.brightcyan.Cyan particle, 0.1000.18.0.1e15.brightgreen.Green particle, 0.0.0.0.1e16.brightred.Red particle; speedmeasure.0, camhelper, orbitdist.0.2.1.cyan, orbitdist.1.2.1.green
Two particles orbiting eachother with a center of mass between them
0.-300.-8.0.1e15.brightcyan.Cyan particle, 0.300.8.0.1e15.brightgreen.Green particle; speedmeasure.0, camhelper, orbitdist.0.1.1.cyan, orbitdist.1.0.1.green
Particle having a non-orbital encounter with another higher mass particle
-1000.1000.1.0.1e10.brightcyan.Cyan particle, 0.0.0.0.1e13.brightgreen.Green particle; speedmeasure.0, particlespeed.0, camhelper, particledist.0.1
